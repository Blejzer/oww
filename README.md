Made with _node_, _express_, _socket.io_ and _angularjs_. It uses separate two servers, to test how they talk to each other.    
  
 
_server.js_ serves as **web server** and talks to the _processor.js_ that **communicates to the database**.  

_Socket.io_ serves to present real time situation regarding the visitor's activities.
